# Project: MMOBossPlanner
_A simple way to explain boss tactics_

## Some info:
### What is this project?
MMOBossPlanner is, as its name implies, a way to plan boss encounters, and to explain boss tactics. It is meant to serve as visual aid in situations where boss tactics may be confusing to explain verbally.

### How do I use it?
This is a "web" application. It can run in your browser. I originally inteded for this project to be used with a framework like NWJS, but it's not limited to that.
Step-by-step guide to run it in your browser:
- Click on the "code" drop-down button
- Click "Download zip"
- Extract the file.
- Double-click the "index.html" file
- Done!
Most of the UI should explain itself, simply hover over buttons and a name or explanation will be displayed!

### Which operating systems support this?
This project was made with Windows and Linux machines. I have not tested this project on a Mac, but it might work!

### Can I use it?
Yes!

### I think I found a bug/ have feedback. What do I do?
If you have found a bug, or suggestions for improvements, you can add it as an "issue" on Github!



## Project status
### Will this project be updated in the future?
It should be, yes. Feedback would be most appreciated as well! How often this project will be updated depends entirely on the time I have, and how much I want to update it.

### Current stage in development
This project is currently under heavy development, but the main branch **should** always have a functioning version.
For those who are interested: The project suffers from a heavy dose of scope creep, as I didn't originally plan for multiple phases, drawing and the number of features. As a result, I will have to refactor the code to make it easier to maintain. If any developers have suggestions for code improvements, that'd be great!

### Current todo list:
- [] Improve the undo function to account for a redo function, and to account for moving units.
- [] Refactor code
- [] Remove console logs in main branch.
